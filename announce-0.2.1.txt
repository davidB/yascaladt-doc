Hi,

YaScalaDT 0.2.1 is released, no new features but some fixes and an update site at :
  http://alchim31.net/eclipse

Fixes: 
* fix the detection of error/warning in sbt console when compiling so you now could use sbt to compile inside eclipse and have markers into your editor (see online installation instruction)
* support multi-line message from scalac
* fix the auto-insertion of */ after /*
* fix the auto-insertion of * at the begining of new line in comments

Current features (same as previous announce):

* basic editor
** syntax highlighting  :comment, string, keyword
** completion of pair (..), {..}, "..", [..], /*..*/
** templates completion
* error marker from console output
* hyperlink/jumper on error/warning from console output (run from maven, sbt, ...)
* basic preferences panel

The EPFL Scala plugin is not required, but it could work with YaScalaDT.

Installation (extract from http://github.com/davidB/yascaladt-doc/blob/master/install.markdown) :

* remove previous version from your eclipse/dropins directory
* add the update-site http://alchim31.net/eclipse and follow the wizard to install the plugin YaScalaDT
* see the documentation for additional configuration suggestion
