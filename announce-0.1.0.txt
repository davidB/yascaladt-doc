Hi,

As some my coworkers, some of you could interested by the first version of my first eclipse plugin ;). There is no site/doc yet.
Current feature :
* very basic editor (comment, string, keyword highlight)
* error marker from console output
* hyperlink/jumper on error/warning from console output

The last 2 features are present in all my editor/configuration and is a must have for me.
Marker/Hyperlink support scala-maven-plugin output. So you could create an extranel tool who call scala:cc (or scala:compile) and have error updated in your project.
I've not test but marker/jumper should work with sbt, builr but you need to custom the command to emit (print to console) the line
 <path>: -1: compiling
then every marker for <path> (could be the root source dir => recursive) are removed/reset

There is no configuration panel.

The EPFL Scala plugin is not required, and both could work together (from my coworker).

feedback welcome. (I already work of the second version, more info near)
