Hi,

I'm happy to announce the second version of my first eclipse plugin ;).

Current features :

* basic editor
** syntax highlighting  :comment, string, keyword
** completion of (), {}, "", []
** templates completion
* error marker from console output
* hyperlink/jumper on error/warning from console output (run from maven, sbt, ...)
* basic preferences panel

Marker/Hyperlink support scala-maven-plugin output. So you could create an external tool who call scala:cc (or scala:compile) and have error updated in your project.
I've not test but marker/jumper should work with sbt, builr but you need to custom the command to emit (print to console) the line
 <path>: -1: compiling
then every marker for <path> (could be the root source dir => recursive) are removed/reset

The EPFL Scala plugin is not required, and both could work together (from my coworker).

Installation (extract from http://github.com/davidB/yascaladt-doc/blob/master/install.markdown) :

* download from https://sourceforge.net/projects/alchim/files/YaScalaDT
* remove previous version from your eclipse/dropins directory
* place the new version in your eclipse/dropins directory
* see the documentation for additionnal configuration suggestion
