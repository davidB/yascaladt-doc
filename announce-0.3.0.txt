Hi,

YaScalaDT 0.3.0 is released, it the same as 0.2.1 + a builder based on scalacs 0.2 (limited to scala 2.7.7).

  http://alchim31.net/eclipse

Current features (same as previous announce):

* basic editor
** syntax highlighting  :comment, string, keyword
** completion of pair (..), {..}, "..", [..], /*..*/
** templates completion
* error marker from console output
* hyperlink/jumper on error/warning from console output (run from maven, sbt, ...)
* basic preferences panel
* basic builder based of scalacs 0.2

So
=> no freeze when typing, compilation on save or on clean/force build
=> no code completion, type inference,...

The EPFL Scala plugin is not required, but it could work with YaScalaDT.

Installation (extract from http://github.com/davidB/yascaladt-doc/blob/master/install.markdown) :

* remove previous version from your eclipse/dropins directory if you installed 0.2.0
* add the update-site http://alchim31.net/eclipse and follow the wizard to install the plugin YaScalaDT
* see the documentation for additional configuration suggestion
